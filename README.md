# Bad Omen

**Bad Omen** is a rogue-like game I created in 2023, for my NEA, using Unity/C#, featuring dynamic gameplay with a procedurally generated map and intelligent enemy behavior powered by an A* pathfinding algorithm. This repository holds, the scripts I created as well as the unity settings for the game.

## Features

- **Procedurally Generated Map**: Every time you play, the world is randomly generated, ensuring a unique experience with each new session.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Enemies use the A* algorithm to intelligently navigate the map and chase the player, creating a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
- **Combat**: Explore, fight, and survive in a hostile world for as long as possible and try to get a new highscore.

## Documentation

Here is a document that goes through my entire process making this game, from designing what I should make for my end users, to designing/modelling it and finally testing and evaluating the final game.
